cuda-npp: A Haskell binding to the NVIDIA Performance Primitives library

From NVIDIA Developer Zone:

The NVIDIA Performance Primitives library (NPP) is a collection of GPU-
accelerated image, video, and signal processing functions that deliver 5x 
to 10x faster performance than comparable CPU-only implementations. Using 
NPP, developers can take advantage of over 2000 (in CUDA 4.1) image 
processing and  signal processing primitives to achieve significant 
improvements in application performance in a matter of hours.

Whether you are simply replacing CPU primitives with GPU-accelerated 
versions or integrating NPP primitives with your existing GPU-accelerated 
pipeline, NPP delivers high performance while reducing your development 
time.
